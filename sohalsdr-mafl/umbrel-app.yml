  Mafl is a very flexible tool for creating your own homepage. It allows you to create lists of services, categorize and track the performance of certain services.


  Ideal for those who have their own home server with a bunch of services. With Mafl you can quickly and easily collect all links in one place.


  In addition to the functionality of regular lists, there are dynamic services. They connect to third-party APIs. They receive the necessary information and display it on the service card. All information is protected. API requests are hidden from the client in a separate application layer.


  Features:

  - 🔐 Privacy. All requests to third-party services occur in backend.

  - ⚡ Real-time. Interactive cards with extra information.
  
  - 🌎 Multi-language. Supports multiple languages.
  
  - 🎨 Themes. Customize the look to your liking.
  
  - 🗂️ Grouping. Create custom service groups.
  
  - 🏷️ Tags. Add tags to your services.
  
  - 👌 Easy setup. A few lines of yaml and your homepage is ready to go.
  
  - 🚀 Fast. Everything is fast and free of hang-ups.
  
  - 🐳 Docker. Optimized docker images for popular platforms.
  
  - ✨ Free. Mafl is completely free and open source.
  
  - 📲 PWA. Installable application.
